This is pseudocode for the first three steps of the search algorithm
Search algorithm

Variables and lists

A= list of cities #or their geographic coordinates?
i=element in list A
x=population   #greater populations will likely produce more plastic waste but we can use a different variable if you guys think it´s better
b=distance to the coast

B=list of cities or locations pre-selected in step 1

j=element in list B
uv=uv radiation
t=temperature # average temperature?

C=list of cities or locations pre-selected in step 2
k=element in list C
sc=sea current (boolean) #if the location in C  is close (we would also need to define how close, right? oh my! ) to a sea current sc=True

w=wind speed #or any other variable that´s more suitable for this
sh=shipping route (boolean) #if the location in C is part of a shipping route sh=True

Step 1

for i in A
   if x>2million #2 million is just a random value I put as an example 
   and b<20km #20 km is another random value only meant as an example
    return i

  #here we might need a list made up of all the elements returned in Step 1 which were selected according to the previous criteria. Let´s call it B.



Step 2

 for j in B   
   if t>20 # 20 is just a random temperature value meant as example 
   and uv > 2000 #2000 is a random radiation value meant as example
  return j

#here we narrow down our list even more. This time, it could be made up of all the elements returned in Step2. Let´s call it C

Step 3

for k in C
  if sc=True and w>some reference value and sh=True

  return k
